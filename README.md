# CubeSat Educational Satellite Platform

Software library for the CubeSat Educational Satellite platform created by Yu Hin Hau (Billy). The "CubeSat" kit is developed to introduce primary and secondary school students to the world of spacecraft engineering and mechatronics! The kit is loosely based off the actual real CubeSat nanosatellite form factor, complete with a deploable solar array and a retention & release mechanism. It is (obviously) not made for space, but as an affordable mean to bring satellite into the classroom setting and spark student interest in space! 

** I couldn't think of a good name for the platform, so it is called the "CubeSat" for now, since it is based off of the real CubeSat platform. **

The CubeSat is powered by a S2 Mini Microcontroller and is based off of CircuitPython along with a large number of eletronic libraries from Adafruit. The library serves as a wrapper for students to achieve more with less code.
